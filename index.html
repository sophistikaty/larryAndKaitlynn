				<p class="rightText">We picked Austin, Texas as our destination for this wedding because we just love the city and everything it has to offer. It's such a refreshing place to visit and live in that it just exudes fun and energy from the moment you arrive. Even with the humidity in the summer no one can deny that Austin is the place to visit in Texas. Whether you like eating, drinking, dancing, hiking, swimming, or just relaxing on a field of grass, Austin has something for you.
					<br>
					<br>

				<p class="leftText">We plan to have two hotel room blocks reserved for ya'll to check out. We're going to pick out a high end downtown Austin hotel as well as one closer to the venue that is more reasonable in price. You are free to pick whatever you preferer. Hotel management let us know that we can reserve blocks beginning in about July, but you're welcome to make other arrangements if you plan ahead.
				<br>
				<br>
				Remember that Austin City Limits (a huge music festival) is scheduled for the same weekend as our wedding and that means that hotel rooms are going to book really fast so if you want to ensure you get a good room at a good price you probably want to book early.
				<br>
				<br>
				Also, here are a couple of great AirBnB options that we recommend in case you're looking for an alternative. Some of these we've stayed at and some just look really cool.

				<p class="rightText">The Austin Airport is one of the coolest airports we've ever been to. It doesn't miss a beat and makes sure that you know Austin is all about music, beer, and being weird. Trust us, you'll never be happier missing a flight than when you're at the Austin Airport. So make sure to grab some ice cream, a beer, and listen to a live band while you wait for your flight out.
					<br>
					<br>
					The Airport is just southeast of Downtown Austin and north east of the wedding venue. If you're coming in on Saturday you'll want to account for a 40 minute drive.</p>

					Austin City Limits is one of Austins biggest music festivals inspired by the PBS television show of the same name. It is scheduled to run for two weekends in 2016 and lucky for you our wedding is on one of those weekends! So not only can you come down to see us you'll be able to see Austin at its best; the capital of music! So if you're interested get your tickets now and make sure to book your hotel early!

					By far one of the best and most unique taco places we've ever been to. Torchy's offers a wide selection of tacos that will never let you eat a taco the same way ever again. They offer tacos of the month where they create and partner with different companies to bring some really adventurous tacos like the Roscos Chicken and Waffle Taco. Yeah, you read that right, a Chicken and Waffle TACO! Make sure to stop for breakfast or lunch while you're in Austin!

				<p class="rightText" id="alamo">
					Alamo Drafthouse is our favorite theater hands down. Alamo Drafthouse started in Austin and is now a growing franchise with locations all over the United States. Their movie going experience has no rival. They offer a full menu including cocktails, beer, appetizers, entrees, coffee, and dessert. They have a strict no talking and no child policy (they offer showings for families), and they allow you to choose your seat ahead of time.

					If you're looking for some fun outdoors you don't have to go far to find it. Right in the middle of the city Austin has an amazing river/lake called the Lady Bird Lake after the first lady Lady Bird Johnson. All around the lake you'll find park areas to ride your bike, have a picnic, or just go out for a walk to take in the city landscape by the water. One of the big venues right by the lake is Zilker Park where Austin City Limits will be held. But if you look a little harder you'll find Barton Springs which is a set of four natural water springs in Zilker Park that are set up to look like a swimming pool. I will warn you though, this water was freezing in July so I can only expect it to be colder in October.

					Larry here: I would be remiss if I don't talk about 6th Street. Growing up my family would always take a summer trip up to Austin, TX to visit one of my uncles and we would drive by the city and something about downtown always attracted me. As I grew older I came to find out that Downtown's 6th Street corridor is one of the most popular entertainment districts in the country. Every night a nine block area is closed to traffic and people are allowed to walk on the street going from one location to the next. There are bars after bars after bars with live music playing every night on 6th Street. After having been to Austin a couple more times the locals have told me that 6th street is divided in three; West 6th, Dirty 6th, and East 6th Street. That's right, the Dirty 6th is right in the middle and is where you will see the most concentration of bars, tourists, and college kids. I loved it. The West side of 6th Street is the more upscale side, the bars have a little more breathing room, and theres no one walking in the middle of the street here, so if you want to have fun but just not in a mosh pit then this is where you go. I almost don't want to share this but our favorite 6th is the East 6th. If you cross the bridge and walk a handful of blocks you'll reach the last part of 6th street to be developed. These are the bars that were the holes in the walls that have slowly been growing and this is where we like to stay if we're in Austin. The vibe is more relaxed but still fun more like neighbohood bars than anything else. 
					<br>
					<br>
					So pick your poison, but pick one!
					<br>
					<br>
					Ps. Look up Rainey Street, it's not technically part of 6th street but its just a few blocks south of the Dirty 6th. Just go, trust me!

					If you're willing to make the drive, Oasis is one of the most beautiful places I've been to. It's situated on top of a hill overlooking Travis Lake and houses a restaurant and a music venue. You can sit outside overlooking the lake and at sunset it's amazing! Literally a must see if you're into sunsets and good times.
